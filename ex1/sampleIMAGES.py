    #  Instructions: Fill in the variable called "patches" using data 
    #  from IMAGES.  
    #  
    #  IMAGES is a 3D array containing 10 images
    #  For instance, IMAGES(:,:,6) is a 512x512 array containing the 6th image,
    #  and you can type "imagesc(IMAGES(:,:,6)), colormap gray;" to visualize
    #  it. (The contrast on these images look a bit off because they have
    #  been preprocessed using using "whitening."  See the lecture notes for
    #  more details.) As a second example, IMAGES(21:30,21:30,1) is an image
    #  patch corresponding to the pixels in the block (21,21) to (30,30) of
    #  Image 1
